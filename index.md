# Welcome to Support for Fraction ERP

Use the sidebar to navigate through the support sections. You'll find everything you need to manage your ERP system effectively.

## Introduction

Fraction ERP is a manufacturing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software application designed for manufacturing companies to integrate processes from enquiry through to invoice. It works in both make to order (MTO) and make to stock (MTS) manufacturing operations.

## Self-On-Boarding with Unlimited Online Support

Fraction ERP is a self-onboarding cloud software application that doesn't require software installation or IT support. We normally do not need to visit customer sites or manage implementation with you. Whilst we can provide additional services like these, it is not our business model and therefore on-site support is chargeable. We intend to make it easy to on-board and use Fraction ERP with minimal training requirements. We provide unlimited online and telephone support.

## Workflows

Understanding the workflow of Fraction ERP will help you quickly pick up how the modules are related. It is also important to understand your own business workflow as part of ERP system implementation. Some adjustments to your current processes are inevitable when implementing any ERP system.
